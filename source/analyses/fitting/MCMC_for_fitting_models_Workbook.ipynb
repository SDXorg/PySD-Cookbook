    "# Fitting a model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a way to infer a distribution of model parameters, given that the measurements of the output of the model are influenced by some tractable random process. In this case, performs something akin to the opposite of what a standard Monte Carlo simulation will do. Instead of starting with distributions for the parameters of a model and using them to calculate a distribution (usually related to uncertainty) in the output of the simulation, we start with a distribution of that output and look for input distributions.\n",

As in the optimization case, we'll modify the effective population and the contact frequency. In real epidemiological modeling, we'd have a more complex model, and we'd have some information about the population, etc. but this makes for a relatively tight example."

If we expected no false positives, we could use a Binomial distribution, such that of `n` possible cases that could be reported, only a fraction `p` would be reported, and other cases missed.

The full rate would be the sum of these two processes.\n",

What this will do, essentially, is take a trial set of points from our prior distribution, simulate the model, and evaluate the likelihood of the data given those input parameters, the simulation model, and the noise distribution. It will then use bayes law to decide whether to keep the trial points or throw them away. It will then choose a new set of points and start over. (There is a lot more cleverness happening than this, of course.

This will automatically include the correlation for us. Clever!"
