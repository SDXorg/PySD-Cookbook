    "You are the chief epidemiologist of the [McMurdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station) Antartic Research Station, a scientific outpost with a population of 1000 persons. A new and unusual disease, currently known as penguin foot, has struck 10 individuals in the camp, and seems to be spreading. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disease has several properties. While infected (and contagious), individuals behave as normal but are unable to drive [snow machines](https://youtu.be/gcIwrdeP21s?t=1m46s), the base's primary mode of evacuation in case of an emergency. (It is universally acknowledged that penguins cannot drive snow machines.) Snow machines can carry one passenger in addition to the driver, and so at any given time, at least half of the population must be able to drive."
