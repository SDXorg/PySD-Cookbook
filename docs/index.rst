The PySD Cookbook
=================
Simple recipes for powerful analysis of system dynamics models

Quickstart
----------
1. Download and install `Anaconda Python 3.7+ <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
2. Install PySD with pip using the command :code:`pip install pysd` at your command prompt
3. `Download this cookbook <https://github.com/SDXorg/PySD-Cookbook/archive/master.zip>`_
   and unzip it to a working directory
4. Navigate your command prompt to the working directory just created
5. Launch ipython notebook with the command :code:`ipython notebook` at your command prompt
6. In the ipython browser, open :code:`source\analyses\getting_started\Hello_World_Teacup.ipynb`


How to use this cookbook
------------------------
Every recipe in this cookbook is an executable ipython notebook. Because of this, I recommend
that you download a copy of the cookbook, and follow along by executing the steps in each
notebook as you read, playing with the parameters, etc.

If you want to implement a recipe, you can then make a copy of the notebook you are interested
in, and modify it to analyze your own problem with your own data.

To download the cookbook in its entirity, use
`this link <https://github.com/SDXorg/PySD-Cookbook/archive/master.zip>`_ or visit
the cookbook's `Github Page <https://github.com/SDXorg/PySD-Cookbook>`_
and select one of the options in the righthand panel.
