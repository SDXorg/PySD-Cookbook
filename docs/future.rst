Chapters to be Written
======================

This cookbook is a work in progress. In the future, I'd like to develop examples in the following
major areas. If you'd like to suggest additional topics, or have a model and/or dataset that
would make for a good case study, feel free to shoot me an email (james.p.houghton@gmail.com) or
post on `the Github issue tracker <https://github.com/SDXorg/PySD-Cookbook/issues>`_.
