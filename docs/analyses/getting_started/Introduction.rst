Introduction to the PySD Cookbook
=================================

**Dear Reader,**

This cookbook is intended to be a resource for system dynamicists
interested in applying the power of python analytics to their simulation
models.

Every recipe in this cookbook is an executable `Jupyter
Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`__ (a.k.a. iPython Notebook). Because of
this, I recommend that you download a copy of the cookbook, open the
source files and follow along by executing the steps in each recipe as
you read, playing with the parameters, etc. If you want to implement a
recipe, you can make a copy of the notebook you are interested in, and
modify it to analyze your own problem with your own data.

Workbook versions of many recipes are available for use in a classroom
setting. In these workbooks, components of the code have been removed
for students to fill in on their own. These are identified with a
trailing ``_Workbook`` in the filename.

You can download the cookbook as a zip file from `this
link <https://github.com/SDXorg/PySD-Cookbook/archive/master.zip>`__,
or, if you prefer, `create a
fork <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__ of the
repository from `its github
page <https://github.com/SDXorg/pysd-cookbook>`__, and clone it
to your computer.

If you come up with an interesting recipe of your own, I'd love to have
`your
contributions <https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/>`__.
If you find a bug in the scripts used in this cookbook, or have a
suggestion for improvements, I'd encourage you to submit `an
issue <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`__ on the project's
`issue
tracker <https://github.com/SDXorg/pysd-cookbook/issues>`__. If
you find a bug in the way PySD itself behaves, the `PySD Issue
Tracker <https://github.com/SDXorg/pysd/issues>`__ is a great
place to raise it.

Thanks for being interested and supportive of this project. I hope you
find the tools presented here to be useful.

**Happy Coding!**
